Title: The Traitis Data Trust
Date: 2020-06-14

We are building a data trust that will allow every employee to register their specific protected traits (e.g. gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion etc). The data trustees will manage access to this data.

The main functions of the Traitis Data Trust include: 

- ### Personal record keeping
Anyone who registered their traits can access and update information about themselves. 

- ### Historical records
The data will be tied to the userâ€™s identity, not just to their employment status, and as such can be carried from one job to the next. 

- ### Transparency
Companies, NGOs, trade unions and other entities will be able to request access to aggregate statistics that will give information on the demographics of a company or specific cohorts.

The data trust will be governed by a board of trustees, who will make decisions about data access on behalf of those the data is about. Ideally, this board will consist of folks who understand labor law, trade unions representatives, security experts, etc.
