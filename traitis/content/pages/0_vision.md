Title: Why We Need A Data Trust For Protective Traits
Color: red
Date: 2020-06-14

How do the companies we work for or put money into make their hiring and firing decisions? Who do they promote and who do they overlook? Do they discriminate against folks from specific religious, or ethnic groups, sexual orientations or gender? 

In order to get a better insight into diversity and inclusion in corporations and other institutions we need data on the traits of their (former) employees. Unfortunately, collecting data on people’s personal traits carries risk: data on someone’s gender, sexual preferences or race can also be used to discriminate or persecute.

Instead, __Traitis aims to create greater transparency around companies’ performance on equity, without creating additional risks to underrepresented groups or those without structural privilege.__

To this end, we will build the legal and technological infrastructure to allow individuals to register their protective traits with a data trust, which will govern this data on their behalf.
