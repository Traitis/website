Protected Traits Data Trust
===========================
:date: 2020-09-04


In order to track companies’ performance on diversity and inclusion, we need to know who they are hiring and firing. Unfortunately, collecting data on people’s personal traits carries risk: data on someone’s gender, sexual preferences or race can also be used to discriminate or persecute. 

:: **Traitis aims to create greater transparency around companies’ performance on equity, without creating additional risks to underrepresented groups or those without structural privilege.** 

To that end Traitis is building a data trust that will allow every employee to register their specific protected traits (e.g. gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion etc). The data trustees will manage access to this data. 

Main functions:
Anyone who registered their traits can access and update information about themselves. The data will be tied to the user’s identity, not just to their employment status, and as such can be carried from one job to the next.
Companies, NGOs, trade unions and other entities will be able to request access to aggregate statistics that will give information on the demographics of a company or specific cohorts. 

The data trust will be governed by a board of trustees, who will make decisions about data access on behalf of those the data is about. Ideally, this board will consist of folks who understand labor law, trade unions representatives, security experts, etc. 

To ensure the data can never be accessed by governments, we will store it in Switzerland and incorporate the data trust in Iceland.
